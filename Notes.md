## Content

### Musicology/Ethnomusicology/Theory, Theory, and Composition are sibling pages

Why is theory listed twice? If these should be separated, then the Musicology/Ethnomusicology area should be alone.

* Do we want to split Musicology and Ethnomusicology, since they each have their own pages as well?
* Home page for the Ethnomusicology/Musicology/Theory area copies the first sentence of the about page and adds links, but ignores theory. Is that a sufficient purpose for another click? Sidebar links to the right are also duplicated in the navigation menu on the left.

### Ethnomusicology

Big questions

* Any reason for an affiliated faculty listing that is specific to the section instead of one for the area? (It makes for a lot of repetition)
* Small ensembles as a separate page?

Minor updates

* Reason for link to bachelors, no link to masters?
* Specializations to include American popular music
* General formatting changes across the board

Faculty listing

* Allison Eckardt Merrill
* Title changes, promotions
* Add me...
* Add/update adjuncts?

Small ensembles

* Update images, make them responsive
* Add audio or video files for each

### Musicology

Combine with ethno?

* Only one ensemble, only a few faculty members
* No discussion of AV, financial resources, affiliated faculty, specializations

### Theory

Useful things that may be worth adding elsewhere

* Sidebar is a useful bullet list, worth doing for other departments?
* Flyer download
* Student accomplishments
* Curriculum tab

Formatting to change curriculum table to text only?

Are admission requirements specific to theory, or should these be more centralized, perhaps on a page that has the curricula for each department?

Student accomplishments sub-page

* Updates, revisions for consistency
* Add other areas, create a master page?

### Degrees & Programs

This feels like it should go on a college-level page. It isn't very specific to the area and links to general topics (like auditioning in China)

#### Undergraduate

Change title to Undergraduate Degree Programs?

Musicology area flyer: any reason this isn't on the other pages (like the theory one)?

What's the difference between an inquiry and contact?

Catalog tab

* Composition accordion dropdown is under history and lit
* Why list the College name in the catalog materials?
* Any updates to the catalog?
* Better way to structure this

Other tabs

* Curriculum guide tab is empty (could be moved into its own page, anyhow)
* Courses offered empty (link to catalog? Descriptions of recent classes?)
* Visit a class needs updating (where is this listing coming from? Why not just assume that it's under Inquiry?)

#### Graduate

Change name of page

Why a button to another page when there's only one option?

Tabs

* Formatting is irregular
* Buttons lead to disorganized places
* This language also feels college specific, too general for the area page
* Use of Caps
* Check spelling
* Heading levels are not consistent with other tabs (some are black, these are orange)
* Tabs overall could have shorter titles for layout

Admissions tab

* Button text is the same color as the button

Assistantship tab

* Spelling issues
* Mix of FAQ and headings

Fellowships

* Appears to be all links to other programs?

Financial aid

* Cost of attendance as link or button?

### Master of Music

Appears to be much more specific to the department

Link to external page with assistantship info, which then links to availability and Descriptions

* Duplicated in tabs
* Could just be two distinct links (or buttons)

Very short interview tab, could fold into application information

* How much of application info is copied from the college page?
* Could these tabs just become links to their source pages?
