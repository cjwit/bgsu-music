## Items to complete for individual pages

* Description updates
* Add audio files and images

### Faculty

* Allison Eckardt Merrill
* Title changes, promotions (Ryan, Megan?)
* Esther? other affiliated faculty?
* Adjuncts?
* Listing interests?

### Musicology

* Musicology specializations
* Musicology-specific resources

### Theory

* Check numbers of faculty/students
* Move parts of this intro/list to the main home page?
* Other resources to highlight, other financial opportunities?

### Student Accomplishments

* Ethnomusicology and musicology placements
* Composition student accomplishments
* Degrees, thesis titles where missing

Listing of current students and interests/photos?

* Working with graduate student organization?
* Information for/about current students?
* Could necessitate a change in title (Current and Past Student Accomplishments or something similar)

### Degrees & Programs

* Check numbers in introduction
* Where does Audition in China go? Is it a major draw for our department?
* Create buttons for other pages
* Add Application and University Admissions buttons on left hand menu to all D&P pages

### Admission Requirements

* Visit a class needs updating (where is this listing coming from?)

### Graduate START HERE

Change name of page

Why a button to another page when there's only one option?

Tabs

* Formatting is irregular
* Buttons lead to disorganized places
* This language also feels college specific, too general for the area page
* Use of Caps
* Check spelling
* Heading levels are not consistent with other tabs (some are black, these are orange)
* Tabs overall could have shorter titles for layout

Admissions tab

* Button text is the same color as the button

Assistantship tab

* Spelling issues
* Mix of FAQ and headings

Fellowships

* Appears to be all links to other programs?

Financial aid

* Cost of attendance as link or button?

### Master of Music

Appears to be much more specific to the department

Link to external page with assistantship info, which then links to availability and Descriptions

* Duplicated in tabs
* Could just be two distinct links (or buttons)

Very short interview tab, could fold into application information

* How much of application info is copied from the college page?
* Could these tabs just become links to their source pages?

### Curricula

* May work well as an accordion dropdown on the Admission Requirements page
* Remove or update current course listings, or link to something accessible from outside of the University
* Formatting to change curriculum table to text only?
* Are admission requirements specific to theory, or should these be more centralized, perhaps on a page that has the curricula for each department?
