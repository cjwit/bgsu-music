The M.M. in Music Theory at BGSU is broad-based, offering extraordinary opportunities in the area of contemporary music. The resources of the [Mid-American Center for Contemporary Music](link) enrich the learning experience with visiting artists and especially with the internationally renowned [New Music Festival](link). Further, the College of Musical Arts-—with around 500 students and 56 full-time faculty members—-offers students the resources and experiences of a large university with the feel of a more intimate setting.

M.M. in Music Theory students therefore enjoy exceptional mentoring opportunities: they receive individual attention, assistantship assignments, and professional guidance that at other schools are typically reserved for doctoral students. Additionally, BGSU is located near several major cities with a vibrant professional music culture, including Detroit, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Chicago.

As a student in the M.M. in Music Theory program, you will gain a solid foundation on which to build a career as a music theorist, researcher, and educator. Fundamental analytical techniques for music from the early modern period through the twenty-first century are stressed within the context of current scholarly thought.

We have an excellent record of placing our graduates in top Ph.D. programs, recently including Yale University, Florida State University, the University of Texas at Austin, and the University of California, Santa Barbara.
