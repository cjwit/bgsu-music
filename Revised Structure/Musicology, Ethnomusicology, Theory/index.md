# Musicology, Ethnomusicology, and Music Theory

Musicology, ethnomusicology, and music theory studies at BGSU help students grow in their exploration of music history, jazz, popular music and world music by studying a range of historical contexts, cultural theory, analytical techniques, styles, sources, and genres.

Undergraduate degrees in [World Music](link) and [Music History & Literature](link) are intended for students who are interested in these academic areas and who wish to prepare themselves for graduate school or work in museums, arts organizations, or other related fields. [Master’s degrees in Music History and Ethnomusicology](link) allow students to pursue detailed work that prepares them for Ph. D. programs in either musicology or ethnomusicology.

The graduate programs require seminars in a variety of topics and methodologies, one foreign language, comprehensive exams and a thesis. Qualified students may also take studio lessons and courses in BGSU’s [Department of Popular Culture](link), [Ethnic Studies](link), [History](link), [Women’s Studies](link), and elsewhere across campus. In addition to BGSU's bands, choirs, orchestra programs, students in both undergraduate and graduate programs also participate in [the department's small ensembles](link) that focus on a diverse musical periods and traditions. These include the Afro-Caribbean, Balinese Gamelan, New Music, Early Music, Taiko, and Steel Drum ensembles.
