# Musicology and Ethnomusicology

Ever wondered about the cultural and social background of Beethoven’s *Ninth Symphony* or Copland’s *Appalachian Spring*? Ever wanted to learn more about Bach’s life as an artist? Ever wanted to learn about and play music from Cuba, Brazil, Ghana, or Mali? The Afro-Caribbean ensemble is comprised of students who love to make music and explore the sounds and cultures of music from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. It's just one part of a unique academic experience for students who major in Music History and Literature or World Music as they become immersed in the background and development of music from the Middle Ages to the twenty-first century, from around the world, and from America's own popular culture.

Music students who have developed a strong interest in music and have demonstrated a high standard of academic achievement may apply for acceptance as a major in Music History and Literature or World Music before the end of their sophomore year at BGSU.

## Degrees Offered

We offer two Bachelor of Music degrees for undergraduate music study. These focus on Music History and World Music and are intended for students who are interested in the academic study of music and who wish to prepare themselves for graduate work. Qualified students may pursue a double major in music history and music education, composition or performance. The degrees combines a general view of music that includes jazz, popular music and world music. Performative experiences reinforce work done in the classroom through participation in the [department's small ensembles, which include the Afro-Caribbean Ensemble, the Balinese Gamelan, the Early Music Ensemble and the New Music Ensemble](link).

The Master of Music in Music History allows students to pursue detailed work in music history and prepares them for further work in musicology. The program includes courses in performance practice, various eras of classical music history, diverse genres, and specially designed topical seminars.

Two music/ethnomusicology degrees--an undergraduate Bachelor of Music in World Music and a graduate-level Master of Music in Ethnomusicology--are integrated within the Department of Musicology/Composition/Theory (MUCT) and include courses on area studies, the literature of the field, participation in [world music ensembles](link), and interdisciplinary studies. The World Music and Ethnomusicology programs are integrated with departments and programs across the campus to allow for coursework in popular culture, women's studies, Africana studies, dance, art history, or other related fields. We offer several teaching assistantships for Master’s students.
