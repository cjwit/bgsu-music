# Undergraduate Degrees

Ever wondered about the cultural and social background of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony or Copland’s Appalachian Spring? Ever wanted to learn more about Bach’s life as an artist? Ever wanted to play music from the Renaissance and Baroque periods? The Early Music Ensemble is comprised of students who love to make music and explore the sounds and cultures of music written long ago. This ensemble is just one part of a unique academic experience for music history and literature majors who become immersed in the background and development of western art music from the Middle Ages to the twenty-first century.

Music students who have developed a strong interest in music history and literature and have demonstrated a high standard of academic achievement may apply for acceptance as a major in music history and literature before the end of their sophomore year at BGSU.

### Music History and Literature

College of Musical Arts

1031 Moore Musical Arts Center, 419-372-2181
Composition

Admission as a Composition Major
A student is accepted for the bachelor of music degree program with a major in music composition by audition before the appropriate area faculty. This audition may be held at the time of the initial College of Musical Arts instrumental/vocal audition or during the course of degree study. It is also possible to add composition to an existing major for a double major. It is highly recommended that the acceptance audition take place before or during the freshman or sophomore year.

Composition applicants are required to submit a representative portfolio of original scores with recordings if available (compact disc or cassette tape), must achieve a passing score in their main performance medium, and must receive a high score on the music theory placement exam. Upon acceptance, the student, in counsel with an advisor, develops a course of study based on degree requirements and the student's needs and interests. If deficiencies are noted, a student may be admitted on probationary status (pre-composition). Students accepted on this status must resubmit a composition portfolio and must achieve a 3.0 grade point average in major area courses within four semesters, except summer. Failure to do so will result in discontinuation as a composition major.

MUCT Small Ensembles
The department offers small ensembles as a training ground for performance practice and a showcase for music of a particular genre, including the Afro-Caribbean Ensemble, Balinese Gamelan Ensemble, Early Music Ensemble, and New Music Ensemble. Participation in a variety of MUCT small ensembles by music composition majors is strongly encouraged.

Jury Examinations
Composition jury examinations occur each semester during final examination week. Students submit a portfolio of work from the semester, and the composition faculty review it. All composition majors are required to take jury examinations each term in which they are registered for MUCT 2160 or 4160. The final grade in composition is determined by combining the grade from the individual instructor with the grade given at the jury. A final grade lower than "B" earned in fall or spring will result in probationary status in composition for the following semester, except summer. A letter will be sent to the student indicating the reason for probationary status, its duration, and the steps necessary for its removal. If the student eliminates the deficiencies within the probationary period, regular status will be reinstated. If the conditions for removal are not met, the student will be discontinued as a composition major. Upon removal of deficiencies, a student may apply for reinstatement.
