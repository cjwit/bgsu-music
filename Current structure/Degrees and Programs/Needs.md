# Musicology

* Thoughts on a banner photo?

## Small ensembles

* Do we want to feature other ensembles (right now it's Afro-Caribbean, Gamelan, Taiko, and Early Music)? (New Music Ensemble, for example)
* Now's your chance to update the description, add audio files, and change the photo

## Faculty listing

* Any title changes or promotions since the last update? (Ryan, Megan?)
* Any other affiliated faculty (Right now it's Esther, Jeremy, and Rob Wallace)?
* Do we want to list adjuncts?
* Do we want to list one- or two-word interests? ("20th century music" or "African diaspora" instead of or in addition to "musicology" and "ethnomusicology")

## Area homepages

* The ethno home page had a paragraph about faculty specializations. Does musicology want to do something similar?
* The ethno page had a paragraph about resources on campus (like the popular culture collection at the library). Anything specific to musicology?
* Does theory want to highlight any special collections or other resources?

## Student Accomplishments

* Theory has a great page listing accomplishments. Does anyone have (ethno)musicology listings to share? (From PARs, perhaps?)
* The theory listing is inconsistent, some are lacking the degree while others lack the thesis title. Is there a central list that I can get those details from?
* Some schools maintain a listing of current students and their interests. Do we have thoughts about this? Could be organized by the graduate student organization

## Course Listings

* As of now, there's a listing of "current" offerings (as of last spring). Is this worth maintaining? If it's for prospective students, we could "feature" information about specific classes instead of keeping a (very) long list.
* Is there anyone who would want to "feature" a class? I assume that this would be the kind of thing that would go well with the CMA's social media efforts.
