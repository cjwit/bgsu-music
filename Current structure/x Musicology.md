The Master of Music in Music History allows students to pursue detailed work in music history and prepares them for further work in musicology. The program includes courses in performance practice, notation and genres, as well as specially designed topical seminars. These experiences are reinforced by participation in the departmental ensembles: the Afro-Caribbean Ensemble, the Balinese Gamelan, the Early Music Ensemble and the New Music Ensemble.

The Bachelor of Music degree in Music History is intended for students who are interested in the academic study of music and who wish to prepare themselves for graduate work. Qualified students may pursue a double major in music history and music education, composition or performance. The degree combines a general view of music history, including jazz, popular music and world music, with more detailed study of cultures, styles and genres. Music history students can also participate in the departmental ensembles, collectively known as the Collegium Musicum (Afro-Caribbean Ensemble, Balinese Gamelan, New Music Ensemble, Early Music Ensemble).
