# About

The goal of the musicology/ethnomusicology faculty  at BGSU is to help students grow in their exploration of music history, jazz, popular music and world music by studying  historical contexts, cultural theory, styles, sources, and genres.  Undergraduate degrees in world music and music history & literature are intended for students who are interested in these academic areas and who wish to prepare themselves for graduate school or work in museums, arts organizations, or other related fields.  Master’s degrees in Music History and Ethnomusicology allow students to pursue detailed work that prepares them for the Ph.D. in either musicology or ethnomusicology.  The graduate programs require seminars in a variety of topics and methodologies, one foreign language, comprehensive exams and thesis.  Qualified students may also take studio lessons and courses in BGSU’s Department of Popular Culture, Ethnic Studies, History, Women’s Studies, etc.  In addition to band, choir, orchestra and small ensembles, students in both undergraduate and graduate programs also participate in the following ensembles:  Afro-Caribbean Ensemble, Balinese Gamelan, New Music Ensemble, Early Music Ensemble, Taiko, and Steel Drum.
